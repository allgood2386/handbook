# What is Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)?

According to the archives.gov website, "Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and government-wide policies but is not classified under [Executive Order 13526](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-11-09/pdf/2010-28360.pdf) or the Atomic Energy Act, as amended."

For Bixal employees: this applies to information that is created or possessed by a Bixal employee for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls, as stated above.
